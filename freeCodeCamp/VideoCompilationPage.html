            <h1>My Favorite Lighsaber Duels in the Star Wars&#8482; Prequels</h1>
            <p>First released in 1977, Star Wars&#8482; quickly became a favorite for many people, two of which were my parents. As I grew up, my dad introduced me to Star Wars&#8482; and I quickly became hooked. Out of the 6 that were around during my time as a child, Episodes I, II, and III were and still are my favorite. Below are 3 scenes showing lightsaber duels, 1 from each movie, that are my all-time favorite moments from the Prequels.</p>

                <h2>Episode I</h2>
                <p>In this scene, the Sith Lord, Darth Maul, makes his presence of himself and the Sith known. For thousands of years, the Jedi had thought the Sith to be eradicated, but found themselves to be wrong during the course of events in this movie. This duel defines the fate of a young boy by the name of Anakin Skywalker, who is the "Chosen One," and is said to bring about the balance of the Force.</p>

                <h2>Episode II</h2>
                <p>In this scene, Anakin and Obi-Wan chase the cowardly Count Dooku into a flight bay and engage with him in a duel. Both Jedi eventually end up losing the fight, but in steps Master Yoda. Yoda overpowers Dooku, who uses a distraction on Yoda in order to get away from the Jedi and escape to Coruscant.</p>

                <h2>Episode III</h2>
                <p>This is just part of a scene that is the epitome of Star Wars&#8482;. This duel ultimately decides the fate of Anakin Skywalker and turns him into Darth Vader. He hurts the one person who loved him the most, his wife, Padme, betrays his master, Obi-Wan, and brings down the entire Jedi Order, bringing darkness to the Republic in the form of the new Galactic Empire.</p>
